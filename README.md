An openRGB python scrolling text output  

## Background  

I have a new computer - it has 4 lovely sticks of RAM with a pile of
RGB LEDs on them.  

What if...  

I can write things out with them?  


So the idea is to take a font, slice it up and shove it at the LEDs.

It works but is super slow.
