An openRGB python scrolling text output  

## Background  

I have a new computer - it has 4 lovely sticks of RAM with a pile of
RGB LEDs on them.  

What if...  

I can write things out with them?  


## Reality  

It's slow.  Too slow for words.  So for the time being, this 
project is going to be boxed.
